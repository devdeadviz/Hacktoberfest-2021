Hi,

The animation works in a way that "pageResources/script.js" creates a image from a pageResources folder
and then replaces the image with the video of gears spinning. Gears are set to absolute position and they will
always be in top left corner. Animation video has a black background so make sure not to change the page background
because it wont look good. I kept all the css style inside the html file. Make sure not to remove anything from
folders pageResources and newDesignRes !
